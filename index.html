  Young Chinese consumers do not seem to think that products from European and American countries are better than domestic brands.
The shift in perceptions has led to an upsurge in the Chinese smartphone market of domestic companies rather than us Apple Corp.
Li Bin, founder of Nio, the founder of the electric car, said the trend would also be shown in the relationship between his company and Tesla in the Chinese auto market.
Chinese consumers have always favored foreign brands for decades, and the products made by European and American companies show better quality than domestic products, the report said. Gradually, the situation is no longer the case.
"When I first went to England in 1997, I felt the difference between China and Europe was quite large." But for the 90's, when they visit Europe and the United States, they do not think there is a significant difference.
Li Bin is the founder of electric vehicle start-ups. He is relying on this trend to help Wei Lai compete with Tesla.
It is reported that the change of Chinese consumers' concept is emerging in many Chinese markets dominated by Western companies. A study released by Credit Suisse Bank in March found that Chinese young consumers are increasingly showing a "preference for domestic brands".
